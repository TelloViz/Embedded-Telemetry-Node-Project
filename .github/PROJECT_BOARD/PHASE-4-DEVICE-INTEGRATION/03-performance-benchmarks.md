# Story: Device Integration - Performance Benchmarks

**Type:** Story  
**Phase:** 4 - Device Integration Tests  
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimation:** 3 hours  
**Labels:** `device-test`, `integration`, `performance`, `phase-4`

## User Story

As a developer, I need performance benchmarks on actual hardware, so that I can verify the protocol meets timing requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Measure packet serialization time on device
- [ ] Measure CRC computation time for various packet sizes
- [ ] Measure command processing latency
- [ ] Verify all operations complete within acceptable timeframes
- [ ] Document benchmark results

## Implementation Tasks

1. [ ] Write benchmark tests for serialization
2. [ ] Write benchmark tests for CRC computation
3. [ ] Write benchmark tests for command processing
4. [ ] Run benchmarks on Pico 2W
5. [ ] Document results and analysis

**Estimation:** 3 hours
